# NoMoreGrayFilter

## Important notice!
I pushed version 1.0.3 to the Geode indexer, but it contained a bug making it not work. I have since released an update, that is yet to be accepted. It should be accepted later today. If you really want the buttons you can download the mod in the releases tab and put it in `\<gd folder\>\\geode\\mods` and it should work.

Removes the filthy gray filter from the Event, Map and Versus button. Should be compatible with any mod, but please report any issue using GitHub. Cosmetic only of course.
Thank you very much RayDeeUx for the bug fixes!
